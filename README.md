# Loan-Defaulter-List

Exploratory analysis of loan defaulters involves examining and understanding the data related to
individuals who have defaulted on their loans. The goal of this analysis is to identify patterns and
trends that may help lenders make more informed decisions about who to lend to in the future.
The first step in this analysis is to gather and clean the data. This may involve obtaining data from
multiple sources, such as credit bureaus and financial institutions, and merging it into a single dataset.

The data should then be checked for missing values, outliers, and other issues that may affect the
accuracy of the analysis.

Once the data has been cleaned, it can be explored using various statistical and visualization
techniques. Histograms and box plots can be used to visualize the distribution of the data.

In addition, exploratory analysis may involve creating subsets of the data based on various criteria,
such as age, income, or loan amount, and comparing the characteristics of defaulters and non-defaulters
within each subset. This can help identify factors that may be associated with a higher risk of defaulting
on a loan. 

Overall, exploratory analysis of loan defaulters can provide valuable insights into the factors
that contribute to loan defaults and help lenders make more informed decisions about lending in the
future.
